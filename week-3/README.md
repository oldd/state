## Prep Work

### DOM Manipulation

* [Traversy DOM Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc) - it's long, no need to finish it before Sunday
* [JS Dom Tutorials: Accessing The DOM](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/index.html)
* [DOM Tree (js.info)](https://javascript.info/dom-nodes)
* [Walking the DOM (js.info)](https://javascript.info/dom-navigation)
* [getElement & querySelector (js.info)](https://javascript.info/searching-elements-dom)

### Sunday Lesson Plan

Study the [Sunday lesson plan](https://hackyourfuture.be/state/week-3) so you come prepared. It's not possible to learn everything in 4 hours, the more prepared you are the more you will benefit from class!

## Assignments

Starting with the exercises will make it easier to complete the project.  Spending a few days practicing before diving into the project will be worth it.

> Before getting started on the homework, take a minute to set up your [Homework Issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) on this module's project board.

### Exercises

#### Isolating JavaScript

* Fork [js-exercises-tdd](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/js-exercises-tdd)

### Project: `even-or-odd`

> [Starter Code](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to create a small application that allows a user to interact with data saved in your website. Your goal should be to learn how to incrementally develop, log and debug your project.  Don't worry so much about making pretty or making quick progress, a finished app is not the goal! To get started [fork the `even-or-odd` repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/even-or-odd), clone it and open the code in VSC.  Here are some tips:

* Go back and forth between VSC and your browser very often.  Every time you make a change in the code, refresh in the browser to test your code and check for any errors.
* Always have your Debugger open.  Take the time to step through each time you program pauses.
* Check the `log` very often!  It's kind of like the debugger, but for your application.  The Debugger allows you to watch memory change in a single function, the `log` lets you see memory change over time in your whole project.
* Take a look through [this module's example projects](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/tree/master/example-projects) for inspiration.

Besides passing the tests, this week you should spend plenty of time practicing [stepping through in the debugger](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome).  The starter code has `debugger` statements already in place to pause your website whenever an event occurs. It might feel a bit slow, but do take the time to step through the test cases and user interactions. Tracing execution like this will help you to understand working with arrays & objects, how functions work, and how the logic of your solution works.  You should especially step through your code _before_ you have passed the tests!  The debugger is there to help you understand what your code _does_ do (instead of what you _want_ it to do) and to find your mistakes.

Your completed project repository must contain:

1. A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
1. One branch for each step of your development, and a complete `development-strategy.md` file.
1. A live demo
